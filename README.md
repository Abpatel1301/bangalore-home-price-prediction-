Banglore Home price prediction Model using SK-Learn

which include : 

  - Data Cleaning:
     
     - Handle NA values
     
     - Feature Engineering
     
     - Dimensionality Reduction
     
     - Outlier Removal Using Business Logic
     
     - Outlier Removal Using Standard Deviation and Mean
     
     - One Hot Encoding
  
  - Build a ML Model.

  - Build UI

We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. 

# Python Library we used in this project
    
    1.Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
    2.Matplotlib for data visualization
    3.Sklearn for model building
    
# IDE & Language

    1.Jupyter notebook  
    2.pycharm
    3.Python flask for http server
    4.HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
